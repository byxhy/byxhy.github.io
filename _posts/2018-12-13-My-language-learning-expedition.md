You’ve always said youth will never stray too far. Yet, those times contain our most happiest memories. Do you remember your high school deskmate? The boy with the brightest smile and the girl with the best-looking profile? Shadow and chalk woven together, black and white split apart, and memories circling round-and-round, With You depicts their three years together: Geng Geng and Yu Huai. The small moments of their growth touch the heart, bringing nostalgia to its climax and memories to their peak.

<h3 id="2"> Chapter 2 - Free Talk with Topic Ⅲ</h3>

### Course Introduction
*  In each part of a class, You will be given 1 topic, 5 words, 1 quote. And you are supposed to give A Speech.

<br />
### Lesson11 - Diet


<br />
### Lesson12 - Climate

I tried to be as rational as possible, but it was the worst of all my classroom experiences. The class atmosphere was abysmal.

* I didn't see any patients in the class. I was just interrupted and told I was wrong, but you didn't try to give any phonetic interpretation. You didn't give any history of words, is it from Latin or Spanish. Just want me to read after you, I can't do that. I'm not sure you're right. In my opinion, your pronunciation is ok, but not that good.
* 你讲句中文，我也能找出你发音的问题，但我会告诉你这个词正确的拼音是什么，为什么这么读，历史出处是什么，从这点看你很业余。
* Your class is read according to the textbook, without any of your ideas. You have students read this, read that, without any guidance, in my opinion, just perfunctory.
* I will be more careful about the ending of every word. Thank you.

Man, you are throwing out truth bombs left and right. Traditional Asian parents will tell their kids to shove their heads into a math textbook and avoid mingling with people of the opposite sex, but once they graduate from college and get a job, they suddenly expect you to be married and bear grandchildren. And people wonder why so many Asian kids grow up as socially awkward robots...
