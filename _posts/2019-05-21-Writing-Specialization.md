>Welcome to Getting Started with Essay Writing!
You’re joining thousands of students currently enrolled in the course. I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to helping you learn more about academic essay writing. To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. A good place to start is the navigation bar on the left. Click Course Content to see what material we’ll cover each week and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course.

>There is a short introduction module, in which you’ll meet your classmates and teacher. Then there will be four other modules, and you’ll need to spend about 4-5 hours on each of those in order to learn the material well. This includes at least 1-2 hours to write each practice essay. For some of you, it may take 5 hours to write an essay. That's ok. Do the work at your own pace. Just make sure you study all of the lesson material before you try to write your practice essays. If you do everything step by step, you'll be able to improve your writing.

>To pass the course, you’ll need to pass four graded quizzes and write three peer-reviewed essays. Don’t worry! You can take the quizzes several times until you get a passing score.

>By the end of this course, you will be able to write three types of academic essays, and you'll have more confidence in your writing overall.

>I hope you enjoy the class! -- by University of California, Irvine
