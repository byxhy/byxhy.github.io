### 1.What is the relationship between Xcode, Swift and Cocoa?
Xcode is an IDE for developing Quick or Objective-C applications, which could make use of the Cacao API (that is an OS API along with a standard library for Mac OS X Cocoa Touch is identical for that cellular devices).

### 2.How to make a ios App?
I don’t care what your app idea is; I know you’ll need to do the following 5 basic things at the very least:

1. Use Xcode: Xcode is the app which is used to construct your user interface and write Swift code in.

2. Know Swift: Swift is the programming language used to make iOS apps.

3. Constructing a user interface: No matter what your app idea is, you’ll need to know how to build the screens and user interface!

4. Handling user interaction: When the user interacts with your app, learn how to respond to it.

5. Expressing computer logic: Every app does something. You need to know how to express logic and process user input!
